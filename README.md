The *Streamlines* package includes:
 - the core *slm* code bundle, which comprises Python, OpenCL, OCaml, and a mixture of Sphinx and Doxygen documentation
 - the *slmnb* bundle, which comprises several sets of Jupyter/IPython notebooks that serve to test and apply *slm* to a variety of lidar DTMs
 - the *slmdata* bundle, which contains a set of preconditioned lidar DTMs, with sinks and pits filled, and issues such as NaN values and data holes fixed, to be used directly in *slm*
