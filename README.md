The *Streamlines* package includes:
 - the core [slm](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm) bundle, which comprises Python, OpenCL, and OCaml codes, along a mixture of Sphinx and Doxygen documentation
 - the [slmnb](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slmnb) bundle, which comprises several sets of Jupyter/IPython notebooks that serve to test and apply [slm](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm) to a variety of lidar DTMs
 - the [slmdata](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slmdata) bundle, which contains a set of preconditioned lidar DTMs ranging from small to very large, with sinks and pits filled, and issues such as NaN values and data holes fixed, to be used directly in [slm](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm)
 - TBD: the [slmxpt](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slmxpt) bundle, containing the results of [slm](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm) analysis of some large-scale DTMs
