# Streamlines master repo

The *Streamlines* package includes:
 - the core [slm](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm) bundle, which comprises Python and OpenCL codes, along with a mixture of Sphinx and Doxygen documentation, and some experimental OCaml
 - the [slm_demo](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm_demo) bundle, which comprises several Jupyter/IPython notebooks that apply [slm](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm) to a variety of lidar DTMs
 - TBD: the [slm_data1](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm_data1) bundle, which contains a set of preconditioned lidar DTMs ranging from small to very large, with sinks and pits filled, and issues such as NaN values and data holes fixed, to be used directly in [slm](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm)
 - TBD: the [slm_app1](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm_app1) bundle, containing the results of [slm](https://github.com/cstarknyc/slm) analysis of some large-scale DTMs
